Happy and productive developers do consistently better work.
Ambiguous requirements can create confusion among the development team and with the client. Avoiding confusion is an important part of the software product manager’s role. There are techniques to properly elicit and express requirements. By spending the time to refine requirements, you can also detect potential errors in your product before it’s even built. By clarifying ideas, development becomes focused and efficient.
Planning
Creating tasks and schedules requires identifying who should do the work, and estimating how long that work will take. Planning includes:
The more specific the requirements are, the clearer it is to estimate how long the work will take to complete! 
If the client asks for more features, a manager effectively monitoring the project can easily gauge whether their team has available resources, allowing them to adapt to changes within the project for a much higher likelihood of success. This moves you from being a reactive software product manager to a proactive software product manager. 
Sam thinks that the team should only develop the essential features that make the product function, and they shouldn't waste their time on the flashy features that the client believes will add value to the product. But that he deems as useless.

“The important thing is not your process. The important thing is your process for improving your process.”

I do see myself, though, as a product leader, 
and I encourage everybody on the team to see themselves as a product leader.

I think we see that

customers don't always have the ability to explain what exactly it is that they want. 
And so we tend to employ a lot of different strategies to 
uncover what it is they want, even if they can't tell us.

We might sit and watch them do their job for a while to help get past the ambiguity 
of them saying something, even and to find out what they actually need. 

So whatever your reason for starting this path, this specialization will guide you 
step by step to become a competent, confident software product manager.
